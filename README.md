SE 4348 Project 1: Batch File Processing 

This project will have teams building a batch file processor. The scope of this effort is to build a tool that parses and executes a batch file containing a number of commands. A batch file, or batch, contains one or more commands that are executed sequentially. Each command executed by our batch processor will be executed as a process and communicate (pass information) using files or pipes.
